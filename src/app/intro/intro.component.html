    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <div id="marketing">
        <p>IT has been my passion since I first entered the computer room of my elementary school but my other passion,
            biology took me away.
            <br>After a few years in nature conservation I've started to educate myself online in web development.
            <br>Since September 2019 I have been working at a public service company. My roles are:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>ERP system management, development, module introduction</li>
            <li>Database management</li>
            <li>Server maintenance</li>
            <li>Web, network and system administration</li>
            <li>Development of new company website</li>
        </ul>
        <p>MEAN stack is my favourite and I'm planning to work as a full-stack JS developer in the near future but
            frontend-only role would also suit my dreams.
